E-Commerce Platform Management 

In this modern era of online shopping no seller wants to be left behind, moreover 
due to its simplicity the shift from offline selling model to an online selling model 
is witnessing a rampant growth. This significant change in business model is 
witnessing tremendous growth around the globe and India is not an exception. A 
massive internet penetration has added to growth of E-commerce and more 
particularly start-ups have been increasingly using this option as a differentiating 
business model. Moreover, E-Commerce has significant influences on the environment. Although 
the model is highly used in current business scenarios, the option has not been 
explored at its fullest. Therefore, as an engineer our job is to ease the path of this 
transition for the seller. Amongst many things that an online site requires the most 
important is a database system. Hence, in this project we are planning to design a 
database where small clothing sellers can sell their product online.
